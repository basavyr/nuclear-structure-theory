# Occurrence of collective rotational motion in quantal systems

- The orientation of a system as a whole (more precisely, the feature of specifying an orientation) is given by the existence of a **deformation**.
- The existence of said deformation implies an **anisotropy** that makes it possible to specify an orientation.
- In the nucleus, the rotational degrees of freedom are associated with **deformations in the nuclear equilibrium shape that result from the shell structure**.

## Rotational degrees of freedom

> The occurrence of rotational degrees of freedom may thus be said to originate in a breaking of rotational invariance. 

- In a similar manner, the translational degrees of freedom are based upon the existence of a localized structure.
- However. while the different states of translational motion of a given object are related by Lorentz invariance, there is no similar invariance applying to rotating coordinate frames.
- The Coriolis and centrifugal forces that act in such coordinate frames perturb the structure of a rotating object

> Breaking of rotational invariance lead to the occurrence of rotational degrees of freedom

> Localized structure implies the translational degrees of freedom

## Transformations on rotating sytems

- Giving the Lorentz invariance that relates to different translational motion of a given object, there is no similar invariance applying to rotating coordinate frames.

- **The Coriolis** and **centrifugal** forces that act in such coordinate frames perturb the structure of a rotating object

- In a quantal system -> the frequency of even the lowest rotational excitations may be so large that the Coriolis and centrifugal forces affect the structure in a major way.

- The *small perturbation regime* (i.e., **adiabatic condition**) for the perturbations is closely connected with the conditions that the zero-point fluctuations in the deformation parameters be small compared with the equilibrium values of these parameters.

- The adiabatic condition provides an alternative way of expressing the criterion for the occurrence of rotational spectra

- The Coriolis and centrifugal forces that act on rotating objects can perturb their states. In a quantal system, the frequency of the lowest rotational excitations may be so large that the Coriolis and centrifugal forces affect the structure in a major way

## Adiabatic condition

- The regime of small perturbations is called the adiabatic condition

- The adiabatic condition is strongly connected with the condition that the *zero-point fluctuations* in the deformation parameters be small when compared to the equilibrium values.

- The equivalence between the adiabatic condition and the zero-point fluctuation in the deformation parameters: 

> a system consisting of **two particles** bound together by a potential possessing a minimum for separation $R$ (the *equilibrium separation*). In this case, the motion of the system can be described in terms of **rotation** and **radial vibrations**. The frequency of the rotational motion, for the lowest states: $$\omega_{rot}\approx\frac{\hbar}{M_0R^2}$$ where $M_0$ is the **reduced mass**.

- The frequency of the vibrational motion depends on the amplitude $\Delta R$ of zero-point vibration: $$\omega_{vib}\approx\frac{\hbar}{M_0(\Delta R)^2}$$

- The condition that the fluctuations in shape be small compared with the average deformation, $$\Delta R << R$$ is equivalent to the **adiabatic condition** $\omega_rot<<\omega_{vib}$ .

- The relationship between members of a rotational band manifests itself in **the regularities of the energy spectra** and in **the intensity rules governing the transitions to different members** of a band.
- For sufficiently small values of the rotational angular momentum, the analysis can be based on an expansion of energies and transition amplitudes in powers of the rotational frequency or angular momentum. 
	- These expressions acquire a special simplicity for systems with axially symmetric shape and in this form are found to provide a basis for the interpretation of an extensive body of data on nuclear spectra
	- The dependence of matrix elements on the rotational angular momentum reflects the response of the intrinsic motion to the Coriolis and centrifugal forces and can be analyzed in terms of the coupling between rotational bands based on different intrinsic structures.
	- For large values of the angular momentum, the rotational perturbations may strongly modify the intrinsic structure of the system. The structure of nuclear matter under these extreme conditions is a matter of considerable current interest.

## Symmetries of deformation
### Rotational degrees of freedom

- The motion of a nuclear system can be separated into a part that describes the **intrinsic** components and the **rotational** components that belong to the total Hamiltonian of the system.
- Such a Hamiltonian has the following form: ![[Pasted image 20210809190606.png]]
	- Within the Hamiltonian shown above, the motion of the nuclear system is described by the **coordinates** $q$ and **conjugate momenta** $p$. These quantities are measured relative to the body-fixed frame. They are thus scalars with respect to rotations of external coordinate system
	- The deformation of the system defines the orientation of the body-fixed frame -> the orientation is specified by the angular variables denoted by $\omega$
