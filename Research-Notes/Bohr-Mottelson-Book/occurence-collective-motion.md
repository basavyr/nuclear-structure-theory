# Occurrence of collective rotational motion in quantal systems

- The orientation of a system as a whole (more precisely, the feature of specifying an orientation) is given by the existence of a **deformation**.
- The existence of said deformation implies an **anisotropy** that makes it possible to specify an orientation.
- In the nucleus, the rotational degrees of freedom
