# Occurrence of collective rotational motion in quantal systems

- The orientation of a system as a whole (more precisely, the feature of specifying an orientation) is given by the existence of a **deformation**.
- The existence of said deformation implies an **anisotropy** that makes it possible to specify an orientation.
- In the nucleus, the rotational degrees of freedom are associated with **deformations in the nuclear equilibrium shape that result from the shell structure**.

## Rotational degrees of freedom

> The occurrence of rotational degrees of freedom may thus be said to originate in a breaking of rotational invariance. 

- In a similar manner, the translational degrees of freedom are based upon the existence of a localized structure.
- However. while the different states of translational motion of a given object are related by Lorentz invariance, there is no similar invariance applying to rotating coordinate frames.
- The Coriolis and centrifugal forces that act in such coordinate frames perturb the structure of a rotating object

> Breaking of rotational invariance lead to the occurrence of rotational degrees of freedom

> Localized structure implies the translational degrees of freedom

## Transformations on rotating sytems

- Giving the Lorentz invariance that relates to different translational motion of a given object, there is no similar invariance applying to rotating coordinate frames.

- **The Coriolis** and **centrifugal** forces that act in such coordinate frames perturb the structure of a rotating object

- In a quantal system -> the frequency of even the lowest rotational excitations may be so large that the Coriolis and centrifugal forces affect the structure in a major way.

- The *small perturbation regime* (i.e., **adiabatic condition**) for the perturbations is closely connected with the conditions that the zero-point fluctuations in the deformation parameters be small compared with the equilibrium values of these parameters.

- The adiabatic condition provides an alternative way of expressing the criterion for the occurrence of rotational spectra

- The Coriolis and centrifugal forces that act on rotating objects can perturb their states. In a quantal system, the frequency of the lowest rotational excitations may be so large that the Coriolis and centrifugal forces affect the structure in a major way
