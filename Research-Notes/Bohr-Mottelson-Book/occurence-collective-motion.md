# Occurrence of collective rotational motion in quantal systems

- The orientation of a system as a whole (more precisely, the feature of specifying an orientation) is given by the existence of a **deformation**.
- The existence of said deformation implies an **anisotropy** that makes it possible to specify an orientation.
- In the nucleus, the rotational degrees of freedom are associated with **deformations in the nuclear equilibrium shape that result from the shell structure**.

## Rotational degrees of freedom

> The occurrence of rotational degrees of freedom may thus be said to originate in a breaking of rotational invariance. 

- In a similar manner, the translational degrees of freedom are based upon the existence of a localized structure.
- However. while the different states of translational motion of a given object are related by Lorentz invariance, there is no similar invariance applying to rotating coordinate frames. 
- The Coriolis and centrifugal forces that act in such coordinate frames perturb the structure of a rotating object.
