# Consequences of Axial Symmetry

- If the system possesses axial symmetry, two consequences ensue:
	- The projection $I_3$ on the symmetry axis is a constant of the motion.
	- There are **no collective rotations** about the **symmetry axis**.



- Regarding the first `a)` implication, this comes from quantum mechanics and expresses the invariance of the Hamiltonian w.r.t. to rotations about the symmetry axis. This means that $I_3$ is a **constant of motion** of the 3-axis is a symmetry axis for the tensor of inertia.
- For `b)`, this represents a feature of the quantal description expressing the impossibility of distinguishing orientations of intrinsic frame that differ only by a rotation about the symmetry axis.
- The consequence of axial symmetry is similar to the **absence** of **collective rotations** for a spherical system
- The quantum number $K$ represents the **angular momentum of the intrinsic motion**, and has a fixed value for the rotational band based on a given intrinsic state.
- The restriction on the rotational degrees of freedom resulting from axial symmetry corresponds to the constraint $$I_3=J_3$$
- where the $J_3$ operator is the operator representing the component of the **intrinsic angular momentum**
- The above equality implies that the operations associated with rotations about the symmetry axis, which are generated by $I_3$, have prescribed values determined by the intrinsic structure.
