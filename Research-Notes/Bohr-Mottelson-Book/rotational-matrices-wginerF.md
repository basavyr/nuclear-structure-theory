# Rotation matrices

## Wigner $\mathcal{D}$ Functions

- The rotations of the coordinate system are driven by the angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics
- The introduction of the newly (rotated) coordinate system $H'$ that is obtained from the original system $H$ by a rotation about a given axis
- The rotation of the system is specified by the rotation vector $\chi$, the transformation of states is given by the equation: ![[Pasted image 20210810200243.png]]
- The rotated state ![[Pasted image 20210810201113.png]] is the state with magnetic quantum number $M'$ as viewed from the newly rotated system $H'$.
