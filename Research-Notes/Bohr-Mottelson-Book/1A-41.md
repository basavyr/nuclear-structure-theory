# Wigner functions - orthonormal set

The Wigner-$\mathcal{D}$ functions form a complete orthogonal set of basis functions in the $\omega=(\phi,\theta,\psi)$ space, with the normalization ![[Pasted image 20210822131523.png]]

## Wigner functions as generalization of the spherical harmonics

- The D functions represent generalizations of the spherical harmonics. (The spherical harmonics constitute a complete orthonormal set of functions on a sphere, that is, in $\theta,\phi$ space or in $\theta,\psi$ space.) 
- Thus, for $M' = 0$ (or $M = 0$), the D functions reduce to spherical harmonics
