## Consequences of Axial Symmetry

- For a system that possesses **axial symmetry**, there are two consequences arise:
	- The projection $I_3$ on the symmetry axis is a **constant of motion**.
	- There are NO *collective* rotation about the symmetry axis.

## Degrees of Freedom Associated with Spatial Rotations

- The three quantum numbers $I$, $K$, and $M$ are used to define *the rotational wave function*: ![[Pasted image 20210818125828.png]]
- If the projection $K$ is null, the Wigner functions are equivalent to the spherical harmonics: ![[Pasted image 20210818125908.png]]

- The equation above describes the stationary states considered as a superposition of components with different values of $K$.
- The third rotational quantum number is denoted by $\tau$ and the amplitudes $c_{\tau I}(K)$ depend on the relative magnitude of the moment of inertia (see section 4-5).

## $\mathcal{R}$ invariance

- The reduction of the rotational degrees of freedom follows if the intrinsic Hamiltonian is invariant with respect to rotations of $180^\circ$ about an axis that is perpendicular to the symmetry axis.
- The rotations that take place about different axes perpendicular to the symmetry axis are equivalent.

### Pre-requisites

- The intrinsic Hamiltonian of the nuclear system has the property of invariance with respect to rotation of $180^\circ$ about an axis that is **perpendicular** to the *symmetry axis*.
- Rotations about different axes perpendicular to the symmetry axis are equivalent
	- For example, one can choose the rotation about the 2 axis $\mathcal{R}\equiv\mathcal{R}_2$.
	- For systems with axial symmetry (but not spherical symmetry) the $\mathcal{R}$ invariance is the only possible additional rotational invariance
	- The invariance w.r.t. any other rotation would imply an infinity of symmetry axes, and hence would imply spherical symmetry
- Restriction on the rotational degrees of freedom that come from *axial symmetry* correspond to the constraint $$I_3=J_$$, where $J_3$ is the operator representing the component of intrinsic angular momentum
	- This condition implies that rotation about the symmetry axis (generated by $I_3$) have **prescribed** values determined by the intrinsic structure.
