## Consequences of Axial Symmetry

- For a system that possesses **axial symmetry**, there are two consequences arise:
	- The projection $I_3$ on the symmetry axis is a **constant of motion**.
	- There are NO *collective* rotation about the symmetry axis.

## Degrees of Freedom Associated with Spatial Rotations



## $\mathcal{R}$ invariance

### Pre-requisites

- The intrinsic Hamiltonian of the nuclear system has the property of invariance with respect to rotation of $180^\circ$ about an axis that is **perpendicular** to the *symmetry axis*.
- Rotations about different axes perpendicular to the symmetry axis are equivalent
	- For example, one can choose the rotation about the 2 axis $\mathcal{R}\equiv\mathcal{R}_2$.
	- For systems with axial symmetry (but not spherical symmetry) the $\mathcal{R}$ invariance is the only possible additional rotational invariance
	- The invariance w.r.t. any other rotation would imply an infinity of symmetry axes, and hence would imply spherical symmetry
