# Rotation matrices

## Wigner $\mathcal{D}$ Functions

- The rotations of the coordinate system are driven by the angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics
- The introduction of the newly (rotated) coordinate system $H'$ that is obtained from the original system $H$ by a rotation about a given axis
- The rotation of the system is specified by the rotation vector $\chi$, the transformation of states is given by the equation: ![[Pasted image 20210810200243.png]]
- The rotated state ![[Pasted image 20210810201113.png]] is the state with magnetic quantum number $M'$ as viewed from the newly rotated system $H'$.
- The states that correspond to the non-rotated system $H$, the magnetic quantum numbers refer to the eigenvalues of $I_3$.
- The transformation from $H$ to the system $H'$ can be accomplished by the vector $\chi$. The direction of the vector itself is given by the set of polar angles $(\theta_x,\varphi_x)$ and it represents the axis of rotation, while the length $\chi$ is the angle of rotation.
- The transformation from $H$ to a system $H'$ with arbitrary orientation with respect to $H$ can be decomposed into three rotations of the type: ![[Pasted image 20210811063750.png]], each rotation being done about a coordinate axis. The angles of rotation correspond to the three Euler angles $\omega$ as such: ![[Pasted image 20210811063929.png]]
- The rotation operator is a **unitary one**, and the expression of the non-rotated state can be expressed in terms of the Wigner functions and the rotated basis as such: ![[Pasted image 20210811151553.png]]
- After the transformation from non-rotated to rotated coordinate systems, the matrix elements for the rotation operator $\mathcal{R}$ has the following form:![[Pasted image 20210811175144.png]]
- The matrix element defined in the equation above has a certain dependence on the Euler angles $\psi$ and $\phi$: ![[Pasted image 20210811175258.png]]
- Each rotated state can be expressed as a sum of products between the non-rotated states and the rotation operator, as described in the expression: ![[Pasted image 20210814080549.png]]

## Transformation between coordinate systems

- The transformation from $H$ to a system $H'$ with arbitrary orientation with respect to $H$ can be decomposed into three rotations of the type ![[Pasted image 20210815070543.png]], each about a coordinate axis. 
- The angles of rotation correspond to the three Euler angles $\omega = (\phi,\theta, \psi)$ needed to specify the orientation (see Fig. 1A-1) that is shown below. ![[Pasted image 20210815070746.png]]
