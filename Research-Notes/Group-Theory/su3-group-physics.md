# Lie algebra Representation Theory
## $SU(3)$ - Representations in Physics

### Abstract 

> The aim of this paper is to draw the connections between elementary particle physics and representation theory of Lie algebras. Generally, the symmetries of physical systems is described by Lie groups, but as it is shown in this paper, the representation theory of groups and algebras are directly related to each other.
