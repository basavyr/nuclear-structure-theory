# Single-particle orbitals in deformed nuclei

- For spherically deformed nuclei, the isotropic harmonic-oscillator is a field that describes the nuclear spectra in terms of the energy,
- In order to amend for the radial deficiencies, the addition of a term proportional to $-l^2$ has the desired properties:
	- effective interpolation of square well
	- interpolation of h.o.
- As a result, a reproduction of the spherical single-particle levels can be achieved by the usage of the **modified-oscillator (MO) Hamiltonian**:
- $$H_\text{sph}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\Delta+\frac{1}{2}M\omega_0^2r^2-Cl\cdot s-D\left(l^2-\langle l^2\rangle_n\right)$$
