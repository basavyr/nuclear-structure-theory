## Key aspects

- the general frame for describing the rotational states in nuclei was done by Bohr and Mottelson in the fifties.
- **Collective excitations** -> coherent movement of a large number of nucleons. Macroscopic models usually achieve a good description of the collective phenomena in nuclei.
- **Rotation** -> typical example of a *collective degree* of freedom in nuclei

### Example of collective excitations

- nuclear fission: very large amplitude shape vibration.
- **shape vibrations** as collective degrees of freedom 
- shape vibrations are described as the variation around the equilibrium value of the $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ parameters introduced in C4
- Nuclear quadrupole vibrations: lab system -> five $\alpha_{2\mu}$ shape parameters
	- body-fixed system: two parameters describe the deformation and three describing the orientation using Euler angles
	- one cannot define any collective rotation around a symmetry axis
	- This is seen from the fact that such a rotation would change only a trivial phase factor in the wave function
	-  collective rotation is characterized by small angular momentum contributions from a large number of particles, i.e. the wave functions of these particles change slowly with increasing angular momentum.
	- ⚠️  What has been said above implies that only deformed nuclei can rotate collectively and, if the nucleus is axially symmetric, the only possible rotation axis is perpendicular to the symmetry axis.
	- For collective rotation, it is then also possible to define one moment of inertia $\mathcal{J}$ , leading to the following Hamiltonian:
	- $$H_{rot}=\frac{\vec{R}^2}{2\mathcal{J}}$$
	- $\vec{R}$ is the *collective angular momentum*. For pure collective rotations, the total angular momentum (it is also referred to as total spin) $\vec{I}$ is equal to $\vec{R}$. The spectrum thus takes the form:
	- $$E_I=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal{J}}I(I+1)$$
	- Since only deformed nuclei exhibit rotational spectra, it is possible to determine which nuclei have deformations, by studying the presence of rotational bands.

	- The moment of inertia $\mathcal{J}$ can be extracted from measured rotational bands. The values for deformed nuclei in rare earth region are exhibited in the figure below, together with the calculated values.

		- The experimental values are generally 25-50% of the **rigid body values**, and they can be calculated with any accuracy only when pairing correlations are introduced.
		- Simpler way to get an estimate of $\mathcal{J}$  is within the two-fluid model, where it is assumed that only nucleons outside the largest possible central sphere give any contribution to $\mathcal{J}$.
		- Chapter 6 ->  the valence particle outside a spherical core determines the ground state angular momentum. This is specific to single-particle effects, thus, several valence particles may partly or fully align their angular momentum vectors to build high spin states.
		- In deformed nuclei moreover, similar non-collective components may be present -> mixture of single-particle and collective components
		- with increasing spin, it becomes necessary to consider single-particle contributions from more particles, and at some point, it seems more appropriate to consider also the collective component from a microscopic pov.
