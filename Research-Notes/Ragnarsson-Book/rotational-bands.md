## Key aspects

- the general frame for describing the rotational states in nuclei was done by Bohr and Mottelson in the fifties.
- **Collective excitations** -> coherent movement of a large number of nucleons. Macroscopic models usually achieve a good description of the collective phenomena in nuclei.
- **Rotation** -> typical example of a *collective degree* of freedom in nuclei

### Example of collective excitations

- nuclear fission: very large amplitude shape vibration.
- **shape vibrations** as collective degrees of freedom 
- shape vibrations are described as the variation around the equilibrium value of the $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ parameters introduced in C4
- Nuclear quadrupole vibrations: lab system -> five $\alpha_{2\mu}$ shape parameters
	- body-fixed system: two parameters describe the deformation and three describing the orientation using Euler angles
