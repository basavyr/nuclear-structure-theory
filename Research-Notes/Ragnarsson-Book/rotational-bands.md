# Rotational bands - the particle rotor model

- rotational band 186f
	- band crossings 198ff, 253-256
	- favoured states 194-197
	- identical 247-256
	- termination 201, 212-216, 218-237


## Key aspects

- the general frame for describing the rotational states in nuclei was done by Bohr and Mottelson in the fifties.
