## Study of the elongation parameter $\epsilon$

- Most of the deformed nuclei have moderate deformations of $\epsilon \approx 0.2-0.3$
- In the limit of very small $\epsilon$, the treatment can be indeed made perturbatively
- Beyond the very small values (e.g., $\epsilon \approx 0.1$), the exhibited perturbation treatment of the $\epsilon$-term is no longer applicable
- At large elongations, one can introduce a representation that exactly diagonalises the harmonic oscillator filed while instead the $\l^2$ and $l\cdot s$ terms are treated as **perturbations**.
- One can write the total Hamiltonian $H=H_{osc}+H'$, where the oscillator Hamiltonian is $$H_{osc}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla +\frac{M}{2}\left[\omega_\perp^2(x^2+y^2)+\omega_z^2 z^2\right]$$

It is convenient to introduce the so-called **stretched coordinates** (Nilsson, 1955):

Using the stretched coordinate system the oscillator Hamiltonian acquires the following form: ![[Pasted image 20210805114432.png]]

- For the spherical case we added correction terms of the type: ![[Pasted image 20210805114500.png]]
- A new $l$ is introduced, in order to correspond to the stretched coordinates: ![[Pasted image 20210805114536.png]]
