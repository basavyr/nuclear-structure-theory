- The technology advance in the process of $\gamma$-detectors led to observation of various phenomena in *rotating nuclei*.

## Signature quantum number

- The rotational states can be characterized by the **signature quantum number** $$r=e^{-i\alpha\pi}$$ which will define the admissible spin sequence for a rotational band according to the relation $$I=\alpha+2n$$, with $n$ being an integer number greater or equal than 0.
- The signature quantum number is associated to the $D_2$ spatial symmetry of non-rotational degrees of freedom of a nuclear system.
