- The technology advance in the process of $\gamma$-detectors led to observation of various phenomena in *rotating nuclei*.

## Signature quantum number

- The rotational states can be characterized by the **signature quantum number** $$r=e^{-i\alpha\pi}$$ which will define the admissible spin sequence for a rotational band according to the relation $$I=\alpha+2n$$, with $n$ being an integer number greater or equal than 0.
- The signature quantum number is associated to the $D_2$ spatial symmetry of non-rotational degrees of freedom of a nuclear system.
- In the experimental data, one will observe two signature partner bands with $r=+1$ ($\alpha=1$) and $r=-1$ ($\alpha=1$) in even-mass nuclei and $r=\pm 1$ ($\alpha=\pm\frac{1}{2}$) in odd-mass nuclei ($\alpha=-\frac{1}{2}\equiv\frac{3}{2}$), which are separated by a signature splitting energy.
	- The band, which is lower in energy is called the *favored band*
	- The signature splitting should increase with an increase of the angular momentum

> Moreover, for some nuclei, the signature splitting decreases with spin, furthermore, the unfavored band becomes lower in energy than the favored one -> signature inversion
