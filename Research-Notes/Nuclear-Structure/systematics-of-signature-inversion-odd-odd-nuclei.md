## Key-aspects

- General features of the signature inversion phenomenon in doubly-odd lighter rare-earth nuclei
- Schematic calculations are carried out within the framework of the **two-quasiparticle-plus-rotor-model TQPRM**
- The systematics can be well explained if the $h_{9/2}$ : $1/2[541]$ proton orbital is included in addition to be complete set of $h_{11/2}$ proton $\otimes$ $i_{13/2}$ neutron orbitals.
